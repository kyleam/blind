 blind
=======

blind is a small program that temporarily renames files or directories.
This is useful in a research setting, where quantification of the
results should not be influenced by knowledge of the experimental
condition.

Dependencies and installation
=============================

The blind GUI depends on wxPython, including the wx.lib.agw. Tests
require pytest. Both the python module and GUI script can be installed
with `python setup.py install` or similar.
